This project allows to make 3D games (for now only 2D games) using only console!

It uses std::cout to output and std::cin to input XDDD

But really its just a library that makes it easy to make simple games and draw on console

Functions it adds:
```
advlinedraw
Usage:
advlinedraw(*"character you want to use",amount,amount of spaces after drawing the line,end this line after completing everything?)
inserttext
Usage:
inserttext("text you want to insert")
```
